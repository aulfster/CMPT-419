# CMPT-419
NLP Project

PythonApplication1 is just a dummy project used by me to test the commit, push and pull functionality.

Global linear models is the project where the author has already implemented the perceptron learning algorithm. I put it in this repository because it is easier to access it.

Note that I have created the above two projects using Visual Studio 2015 community edition. Feel free to which ever editor though :)
